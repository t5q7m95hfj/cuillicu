    <p>Just beyond the gate, outside the apartment complex, lies my favorite park. It’s dirty, with dog poop and shards of beer bottle glass, but hardly anyone is there during the day.</p>

    <p>My favorite bench is the third one down. I’ve become friends with the moss and cigarette butts beneath my feet. And when the light is just right, I see the shirtless man, whom I’ve named Tony, doing God knows what exercises on his balcony.</p>

    <p>I’ve formed this little, unbeknownst community, without talking about my roommates, of course.</p>

    <p>“We’re not even at the park, Yousef.”</p>

    <p>But they kick the ball around, anyway. They’re not always here, but sometimes. Especially on Saturdays. Yousef is the littlest one. I can tell because they always call his name.</p>

    <p>It’s almost winter, but it’s not quite cold. I still wear a down coat, though. It has a hood in case it rains.</p>

    <p>Two dogs, one unleashed, size each other up. And then calm returns. The leashed dog’s owners grumble off into the distance.</p>

    <p>For dinner, I’ve decided on gnocchi. While I was leaving, I smelled what the neighbors were cooking. I don’t know what it was, but it smelled good: a symphony of heat, spice, and aromatics. Maybe if I knew them, they could teach me how to cook like them.</p>

    <p>I took the tram today. As if I had a choice. I got off before the last stop and got on the metro. It would be more convenient if my job reimbursed taxis when the company car broke down. It’s not my fault after all.</p>

    <p>At lunch I went to the bakery, where they always bake fresh bread. I don’t like the taste so much as I admire the warmth. Clementine let her hair down today. I like it that way.</p>

    <p>I was the first one home. So I closed all the windows, like I’m supposed to do.</p>

    <p>Rudolph, true to his <em>Mutterland</em>, practices <em>lüften</em> and expects us to, as well. Except, isn’t it meant to be measured in minutes, and not hours?</p>

    <p>I put on <em>Sinners</em> on our IPTV. Sorry, Coogler. But I love this film.</p>

    <p>When Simon came home, I didn’t even bat an eye. I was too immersed.</p>

    <p>“What’s up?”</p>

  jupiter: `

    <p>My feet are cold as I sit in bed – alone…</p>

    <p>Happy Valentine’s Day to my single self for the umpteenth time. Why hasn’t AI bioengineered me a perfect man? Or at least matched me with an imperfect one. Are my standards too high?</p>

    <p>No, but my expectations are.</p>

    <p>The truth is… I don’t want a man. Not in the “I’m straight” sense, but as in: would I actually feel fulfilled by being doted on by a partner? And frankly, I don’t believe I deserve that anyway…</p>

    <p>I &lt;3 myself – in theory but not in practice.</p>

    <p>My life is a conscious contradiction. It’s like I’m the moon to my own planet, barely hanging in orbit by the delicate balance of gravitational forces. I have an “objective” and out-of-body view of myself, but I’m still just a self. And what is a self anyway? That which is defined in relation to the other?</p>

    <p>I am the other and the self, the one and the many, defined in relation to myself and to others.</p>

    <p>I’m boring myself already…</p>

    <p>Well anyway, at the store today I was reminded just how much of a capitalistically-contrived, meaning-averse, arbitrary pity of a holiday Valentine’s Day really is.</p>

    <p>Pathetic men buying pathetic cards and pathetic flowers which will never see the sun and are supposed to symbolize eternal love but will probably be in the garbage by Friday.</p>

    <p>One guy was getting mad at the cashier because the envelope didn’t fit his $6 Hallmark card. A piece of card-stock with a generic platitude at such an exorbitant cost. Smells like love to me!</p>

    <p>And why don’t we philosophize anymore?</p>

    <p>I mean, wouldn’t a truer gesture of love be to recreate a modern version of Plato’s <em>Symposium</em> – where we get drunk and profess our odes to the deity of Love?</p>

    <p>Like Diotima said: Love is our humanly attempt at attaining immortality, with love being passed from parent to child, from one generation to the next, through a process of unbridled succession.</p>

    <p>And I love platonic love – a love of love itself, as meta as Plato’s tale.</p>

    <p>I &lt;3 myself after all, and that’s as meta as it can get.</p>

    <p>Well, enough rambling for now.</p>

    <p>Goodnight Jupiter and all my moons. xoxo.</p>
